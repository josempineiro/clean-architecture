# Clean Architecture Documentation Module

Welcome to the Clean Architecture Documentation Module! This space serves as a comprehensive guide to the implementation of Clean Architecture (also known as Hexagonal Architecture) within our project. Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability by structuring the application into distinct layers, each with its specific purpose.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this module is to provide developers, architects, and stakeholders with a clear understanding of the architectural choices made in our project. By documenting entities, use cases, components, and their interactions, we aim to:

- **Facilitate Understanding:** Help team members and newcomers comprehend the project's structure and how different modules and components interact with each other.

- **Encourage Best Practices:** Promote adherence to Clean Architecture principles, ensuring code maintainability, scalability, and testability.

- **Simplify Onboarding:** Assist new developers in quickly grasping the project's architecture, enabling them to contribute effectively from the start.

- **Support Decision Making:** Provide context for architectural decisions, allowing stakeholders to make informed choices about project direction and evolution.

## What You'll Find Here

### **Entities:**
   Explore the core entities within our application. Entities represent the business objects manipulated by the application. They are at the heart of the domain layer.

### **Use Cases:**
   Dive into the application's specific use cases, each encapsulating a discrete piece of business logic. Use cases define the application's behavior and orchestrate interactions between entities.

### **Components:**
   Understand the different components and modules in the application. Components encapsulate technical concerns and implement the interfaces defined by the use cases.

### **Interactions:**
   Learn about how entities, use cases, and components interact with each other. Understand the flow of data and operations within the application.

### **Testing Strategies:**
   Delve into our testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. Learn how Clean Architecture enables comprehensive testing, ensuring the reliability of our application.

By exploring these sections, you'll gain valuable insights into the inner workings of our project and how Clean Architecture principles guide our development process.

Let's embark on this journey of understanding, collaboration, and code quality! Happy reading! ðŸš€
