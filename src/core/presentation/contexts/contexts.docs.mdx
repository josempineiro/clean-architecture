# Core Presentation Contexts Module Documentation

## Introduction

The `core/presentation/contexts` module in Clean Architecture serves as a dedicated space for managing global state, application context, and shared functionalities within the presentation layer. This module focuses on creating React Contexts, Hooks, and Providers that encapsulate shared state logic, enabling components to access data without prop drilling and ensuring a unified approach to managing application-wide concerns. By centralizing context-related code, the `core/presentation/contexts` module promotes reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns in adherence to the principles of Clean Architecture.

## Purpose of the Core Presentation Contexts Module

### Global State Management

The `core/presentation/contexts` module houses React Contexts and Providers for managing global state across components. By defining context providers here, the module centralizes the logic for handling application-wide data, such as user authentication status, theme preferences, language settings, and other global variables.

### Shared Functionality and Hooks

Common functionalities, such as data fetching, form validation, authentication flows, and user permissions, are encapsulated within custom React Hooks defined in the `core/presentation/contexts` module. These hooks abstract complex logic, enabling components to access shared functionality without duplicating code, ensuring consistency and modularity.

### Application-wide Themes and Styles

Contexts related to theming, color schemes, and styles are managed within this module. Theme contexts provide components with the ability to adapt their appearance based on user preferences, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.

### User Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization contexts handle user login state, user roles, and permissions. By centralizing these concerns, the module provides a consistent approach to managing user sessions, securing routes, and controlling access to specific features based on user roles.

## Benefits of the Core Presentation Contexts Module

### Encapsulation of Shared State

By encapsulating shared state and functionality within contexts, the `core/presentation/contexts` module prevents global state from polluting the rest of the application. Components can consume context data without having to know the internal implementation details, promoting separation of concerns and modularity.

### Reusability and Testability

The shared functionality and state management provided by contexts are designed for reuse. This reusability simplifies the development of new components and features, enabling developers to leverage existing contexts without rewriting logic. Additionally, unit testing of components becomes more straightforward as context-related functionality can be easily mocked or tested in isolation.

### Consistent User Experience

By centralizing theming, styles, and global state management, the module ensures a consistent user experience throughout the application. Changes in themes, language preferences, or user authentication status are instantly reflected across all components, maintaining a seamless and unified user interface.

## Conclusion

The `core/presentation/contexts` module in Clean Architecture plays a crucial role in managing shared state, encapsulating functionality, and ensuring consistency in the presentation layer. By providing a structured approach to global state management, context-driven development, and shared functionality, this module facilitates the creation of scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly React applications. Embracing the principles of Clean Architecture, the `core/presentation/contexts` module significantly contributes to the development of robust, responsive, and feature-rich user interfaces.
