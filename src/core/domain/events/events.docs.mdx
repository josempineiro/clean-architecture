# Core Domain Events Module Documentation

## Introduction

The `core/domain/events` module in Clean Architecture serves as a centralized hub for managing common domain events within the application. Domain events are occurrences or state changes within the domain layer that are significant to the business and can trigger reactions in other parts of the application. This module encapsulates various event classes, each representing a specific type of domain event. By organizing domain events in a structured manner, the `core/domain/events` module ensures consistent event handling and promotes a clear approach to managing domain-driven interactions and state changes.

## Purpose of the `core/domain/events` Module

### Standardized Event Representations

The primary purpose of the `core/domain/events` module is to provide standardized event representations for domain-specific occurrences. Each event class within this module represents a distinct domain event, such as user registration, order placed, or payment completed. Standardizing event classes ensures uniformity in event handling and enables developers to publish and subscribe to specific types of events.

### Encapsulation of Domain Logic

By encapsulating domain events within this module, the application ensures that domain-related interactions and state changes are captured within the domain layer. Domain events encapsulate meaningful information about state transitions, enabling other parts of the application to react appropriately. This encapsulation enhances the modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## Common Domain Events

### `UserRegisteredEvent`

The `UserRegisteredEvent` class represents an event where a new user is successfully registered in the system. This event may contain user details such as ID, name, and email address.

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
const event = new UserRegisteredEvent(userId, userName, email);
eventBus.publish(event);
```

### `OrderPlacedEvent`

The `OrderPlacedEvent` class signifies an event where a new order is placed by a customer. This event may contain order details such as order ID, products, and customer information.

#### Example Usage:

```typescript
const event = new OrderPlacedEvent(orderId, products, customerInfo);
eventBus.publish(event);
```

## Benefits of the `core/domain/events` Module

### Decoupled Communication

By utilizing domain events, different parts of the application can communicate and react to state changes without direct dependencies. Events provide a decoupled way for components and modules to interact, promoting modularity and reducing tight coupling between components.

### Scalability and Extensibility

The use of domain events facilitates the addition of new features and behaviors without modifying existing components. Events can be subscribed to by multiple listeners, allowing the application to scale and adapt to changing requirements without major refactoring efforts.

## Conclusion

The `core/domain/events` module in Clean Architecture serves as a key mechanism for managing domain-specific interactions and state changes within the application. By embracing domain events, the application gains flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. Standardizing event representations and decoupling communication between components, this module contributes to the development of robust, adaptable, and business-driven software applications.
