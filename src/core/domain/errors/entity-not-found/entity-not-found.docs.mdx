# Core Domain Error: `EntityNotFound`

## Introduction

The `EntityNotFound` class, residing in the `core/domain/errors/entity-not-found` module, is a specialized error class in Clean Architecture designed to handle situations where a specific entity, identified by its unique identifier, cannot be found. This error class extends the native JavaScript `Error` object and provides a consistent and informative way to indicate that an entity with a given ID does not exist in the application's domain. By centralizing this error logic, the module ensures consistent error handling and promotes a clear approach to managing missing entities in the domain layer.

## Purpose of `EntityNotFound`

### Error Signaling

The primary purpose of the `EntityNotFound` class is to signal an error when an attempt to retrieve or manipulate an entity fails due to non-existence. This error class is thrown to indicate that the requested entity, identified by a specific ID, does not exist in the application's data store or database.

### Contextual Error Message

The `EntityNotFound` class constructs a meaningful error message that includes the type of entity and the provided ID. The purpose of this contextual information is to assist developers and users in understanding the cause of the error. The error message communicates which entity was not found and advises on potential actions, such as verifying the correctness of the provided ID or checking the entity's existence in the database.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { EntityNotFound } from 'core/domain/errors/entity-not-found';

function findEntityById(id: string): Entity {
  const entity = // logic to retrieve entity from the database;
  if (!entity) {
    throw new EntityNotFound('Entity', id);
  }
  return entity;
}
```

In this example, the `EntityNotFound` error is thrown when the `findEntityById` function fails to find the entity with the specified ID.

## Benefits of `EntityNotFound`

### Consistent Error Handling

By utilizing the `EntityNotFound` class, the application ensures a consistent approach to handling entity not found errors. Developers can rely on a standardized error structure, simplifying the error handling process across different parts of the system.

### Informative Error Messages

The error messages generated by the `EntityNotFound` class provide detailed information about the missing entity, making it easier for developers to identify the problematic entity and address the issue effectively. This contributes to faster debugging and issue resolution.

## Conclusion

The `EntityNotFound` class in the `core/domain/errors/entity-not-found` module serves as a crucial tool in Clean Architecture for handling missing entities within the application domain. By encapsulating entity not found error logic and providing informative error messages, this class enhances the reliability, maintainability, and user experience of the application. Embracing the principles of Clean Architecture, the `EntityNotFound` class helps build robust and user-friendly software applications.
